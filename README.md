# Data Engineering Journey

## About
This repository tracks my 3-month data engineering learning journey. It includes:

- Daily SQL and Python DSA challenges
- Projects built using PySpark, Airflow, AWS, and other data engineering tools
- Notes and resources for learning

## Goals
1. Master core tools for Data Engineering: PySpark, Airflow, AWS, SQL
2. Build two real-world projects (ETL pipeline, real-time streaming)
3. Practice SQL and Python DSA every day to prepare for job interviews

## Structure
- **Projects**: Completed ETL pipelines, data transformations, and streaming solutions.
- **Daily Challenges**: SQL and Python challenges that I solve daily (organized by weeks).
- **Notes**: Useful resources, learning paths, and documentation.
